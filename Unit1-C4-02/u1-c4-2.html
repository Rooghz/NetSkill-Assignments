    <p><b>Book Name : </b>Finnegans Wake, by James Joyce</p>
    <p><b>Description : </b>Finnegans Wake is a complex novel that blends the reality of life with a dream world. The motive idea of the novel, inspired by the 18th-century Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico, is that history is cyclical. To demonstrate this, the book ends with the first half of the first sentence of the novel.</p>
